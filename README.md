# rucksack ðŸš§

A rucksack is a distributed key-value database.
The project is essentially an attempt to get deeper into distributed systems and database internals.
It's inspired by [tinyKV course](https://github.com/talent-plan/tinykv) and [MIT 6.5840](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html).
The overall architecture, some design decisions and parts of code will be taken from [tinyKV course](https://github.com/talent-plan/tinykv), with copyrights of course.

__Why not re-use the tinyKV repo?__
TinyKV contains lots of things that confuse me. Since the main goal is to build a DB, but also
understand approaches and tradeoffs, I think it's better to start from scratch.
